        <h1>About the Reaction Tester Game</h1>
        <p>
            This mini-game challenges you to click the box as fast as possible 
            after it randomly appears. Your reaction time is measured in seconds.
        </p>

        <h3>How it works:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A box appears on the screen at random times.</li>
            <li>Your goal is to click it as fast as you can.</li>
            <li>The game records your reaction time in seconds.</li>
            <li>You can replay to improve your timing.</li>
        </ul>
